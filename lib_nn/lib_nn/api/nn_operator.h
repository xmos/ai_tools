/**
 * @brief Perform a 2D convolution of a shallow input image.
 * 
 * Perform a 2D convolution of kernel tensor @tensor{K} with input image @tensor{X}
 * to produce output image @tensor{Y}.
 *  
 * This function is optimized for input images that have 3 channels, but will work
 * with any number of input channels. This will use more memory than the TFLite 
 * reference implementation, but run much faster:
 * 
 * Additional memory: 1 patch worth (K_w * K_h * C_in) bytes + 32 bytes + some code
 * Performance gain: Depends on patch size vs # output channels, and padding, but approximately:
 *                   16x faster convolutions - PATCH_SIZE copy operations
 * 
 * @note multiples of 16 output channels will run fastest input channels not imporant, but a PATCH_SIZE 
 * that is a multiple of 32 will be the fastest, most memory effcient
 *

 * address of the output image tensor, *not* the start address of the sub-tensor being computed by the 
 * current job.
 * 
 * `X` points to the input image tensor @tensor{X} with shape @tensor_shape{X_h, X_w, X_c}, which 
 * correspond to the input image rows, columns and channels respectively. The dimensions of @tensor{X}

 * convolution window columns, and the input image channel count respectively.
 * 
 * The memory layout of @tensor{K} is a row-major 2D matrix
 * 
 * `BSO` points to an array of bias-shifts-scale parameters required for this convolution. Each 
 * `nn_bso_block_t` in the array contains the bias-shifts-scale parameters for a single output channel group,
 * (@ttref{VPU_INT8_ACC_PERIOD} output channels). If @math{Y_c} is not a multiple of @ttref{VPU_INT8_ACC_PERIOD}, 
 * then the output channel tail ( the last @math{(Y_c mod 16)} output channels) also gets `nn_bso_block_t`, where
 * the entries corresponding to channels beyond @math{Y_c} are ignored. The address supplied for `BSO` should be
 * the start address of the the array, *not* the address of the `nn_bso_block_t` corresponding of the first output
 * channel of the job being processed.
 *
