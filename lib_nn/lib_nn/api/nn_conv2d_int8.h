/** 
 * @brief Initialize an instance of the @oper{conv2d_deep} operator.
 * 
 * See @oper_ref{conv2d_deep} for more details about the @oper{conv2d_deep} operator. To invoke a @oper{conv2d_deep} 
 * job, call conv2d_deep().
 * 
 * When conv2d_deep() is called, a plan (`nn_conv2d_deep_plan_t`) and a job (`nn_conv2d_deep_job_t`) must be supplied 
 * to tell it how to do its work. This function initializes that plan and one or more jobs to be supplied in subsequent 
 * calls to conv2d_deep().
 * 
 * A plan contains information shared by all jobs of an instance of @oper{conv2d_deep}. Each job computes a rectangular 
 * sub-tensor of the output image (possibly the entire image).
 * 
 * `plan` points to the plan to be initialized. It need only be initialized once for many calls to conv2d_deep().
 * 
 * `jobs` points to an array of `nn_conv2d_deep_job_t` to be initialized. Each element represents one job. There should 
 * be `job_count` elements in the array.
 * 
 * `x_params` points to the image parameters for the instance's input image @tensor{X}.
 * 
 * `y_params` points to the image parameters for the instance's output image @tensor{Y}.
 * 
 * `job_params` points to either an array of `nn_conv2d_job_params_t` structs or else is `NULL`. A `job_params` value of  
 * `NULL` indicates that there will only be a single job which computes the entire output image. If `job_params` is 
 * `NULL`, then `job_count` must be `1`. If `job_params` is not `NULL`, it must point to an array of `job_count` 
 * `nn_conv2d_job_params_t` elements.
 * 
 * In particular, job `k` will compute the output elements @math{Y[r,c,p]} for which:
 * @inlinecode
 *     job_params[k].start.rows <= r < job_params[k].start.rows + job_params[k].size.rows
 *     job_params[k].start.cols <= c < job_params[k].start.cols + job_params[k].size.cols
 *     job_params[k].start.channels <= p < job_params[k].start.channels + job_params[k].size.channels
 * @endinlinecode
 * 
 * If multiple jobs are specified, it is the user's responsibility to ensure that the supplied list of job params 
 * collectively computes the entire output image (no gaps) and does not compute any output values redundantly (no 
 * overlap).
 * 
 * `conv_window` points to a `nn_window_params_t` struct containing the instance's @math{K_h}, @math{K_w}, 
 * @math{W_{vert}), @math{W_{hori}), @math{W_{r0}) and @math{W_{c0}} hyperparameters (see @ref 
 * conv2d_deep_hyperparameters) which describe the relationship between the input image, the convolution window and the 
 * output image.
 * 
 * `conv_window->shape` specified @math{K_w} and @math{K_h}, the height and width of the convolution window. 
 * 
 * `conv_window->start` specifies @math{W_{r0}} and @math{W_{c0}}, the starting row and column of the convolution window 
 * in @tensor{X}'s coordinate space. For example, a `start` value of `(0,0)` indicates that the top-left pixel of the 
 * output image has the convolution window aligned with the top-left corner of the input image, with no implied padding 
 * at the top or left sides of the input image.
 * 
 * `conv_window->stride.horizontal` specifies @math{W_{vert}} and @math{W_{hori}}, the vertical and horizontal strides 
 * of the convolution window. The strides describe the number of pixels the convolution window moves (across the input 
 * image) with each pixel in the output image.
 * 
 * `zero_point` specifies @math{z_0}, the value associated with the (implied) padding space around the input image. For 
 * any output pixel whereupon the corresponding convolution window location in the input image extends beyond the bounds 
 * of the input image, those coefficients in the convolution window which are in the padding are multiplied by 
 * @math{z_0} rather than by values from the input image. All input channels currently share a common zero-point value.
 *

 * This function is optimized for input images that have 3 channels, but will work

 * reference implementation, but run much faster:
 * 
 * Additional memory: 1 patch worth (K_w * K_h * C_in) bytes + 32 bytes + some code
 * Performance gain: Depends on patch size vs # output channels, and padding, but approximately:
 *                   16x faster convolutions - PATCH_SIZE copy operations
 * 
 * @note multiples of 16 output channels will run fastest input channels not imporant, but a PATCH_SIZE

 * The above shows a 3x3 convolution kernel being scanned horizontally across (centered
 * on) the top row of a 5x7 input image. The convolution window shifts, with a horizontal
 * stride of 2 pixels each time to produce 4 adjacent output pixels. (The example does
 * not indicate the number of image channels.)
 * 
 * In this example, the top row of the convolution window is in padding the whole time, 
 * while the padding on the left and right edges changes.
 * 
 * This example corresponds to calling `nn_compute_patch_depthwise_padded_asm()` 4 times
 * with appropriate adjustments made to its `Y`, `X`, `pad_l`, and `pad_r` arguments
 * each time. That is what this function does, only more efficiently. To perform a full
 * depthwise convolution, this function can be called multiple times, with `Y`, `X`, 
 * `pad_t`,  `pad_b` appropriately adjusted each time.
 * 
 * In the documentation that follows, "input image patch" or just "patch" refers to the
 * region of the input image which is inside the convolution window.
 * 
 *  
 * `Y` is the memory location at which to write the first output values. This address
 * will be incremented by `Y_c` bytes following each of the `out_pixels` outputs.
 * 
 * `X` points to the location in (or near) the input image where the convolution window
 * will start. The input image at which `X` points has `K_c` channels. If the top-left
 * spatial cell of the convolution window is in padding at its first location, then
 * the `X` pointer may point outside the actual input image's memory. Specifically, from
 * the example above, if the input image is defined as
 * \code
 *      int8_t input_image[5][7][K_c];
 * \endcode
 * then `X = &input_image[-1][-1][0]`. If the appropriate padding values are provided,
 * this function will never perform a read from such an invalid location.
 * 
 * `K` is the convolution kernel, and has shape `(K_h, K_w, K_c)`.
 * 
 * `BSO` are the biases shifts and scale which are applied to the convolution. See _________
 * 
 * `K_h` is the height of the convolution window in pixels.
 * 
 * `K_w` is the width of the convolution window in pixels.
 * 
 * `pad_t` and `pad_b` are the number of rows of padding at the top and bottom of the
 * convolution window respectively. As the window only strides horizontally, this padding 
 * will not change during a single invocation of this function. These values are 
 * non-negative. In the example above, `pad_t` is `1`, because the top row of the 
 * convolution kernel is in padding, and `pad_b` is `0` (NOT `-3`) because none of the
 * convolution window is below the input image.
 * 
 * `pad_l_initial` and `pad_r_inital` are the possibly-negative number of columns of
 * padding on the left and right sides of the convolution window respectively at the 
 * _first_ window location. Unlike the top and bottom padding, the padding at the left
 * or right may change with each window stride. In order to correctly and efficiently
 * track this padding change, negative values may need to be supplied. For example,
 * in the case above, `pad_l_initial` is `1`, because the left-most column of the
 * convolution window is in padding, and `pad_r_initial` is `-5`, because there are
 * `5` image pixels between the right edge of the convolution window and the right
 * edge of the input image. The relation `pad_l_initial + pad_r_initial == K_w - X_w` 
 * should always be true.
 * 
 * `K_c` is the number channels in the input image.
 * 
 * `x_row_stride` is the number of _bytes_ between end of one row of an input image patch
 * and the start of the next row of the input image patch. In the example above, `x_row_stride`
 * would be `(7-3)*K_c`, because the input image is `7` pixels wide, the convolution
 * window is `3` pixels wide, and there are `K_c` bytes per pixel.
 * 
 * `window_hstride` is the number of _bytes_ by which the convolution window will be
 * moved to the right for each output pixel. In the example above, the horizontal 
 * stride of the convolution window is 2 pixels, and so `window_hstride` would be
 * `2*K_c`, because each pixel of the input image is `K_c` bytes.
 * 
 * `Y_c` is the number of channels in the output image, or equivalently, the number of
 * bytes per pixel of the output image. The pointer `Y` is incremented by `Y_c` for
 * each output written. (`chans_to_write` bytes are written at each location.)
 * 
 * `out_pixels` is the number of output pixels to write.
 * 
 * `chans_to_write` is the number of output channels to be written. 
 * 
 * `zero_point_vec` is a vector of `chans_to_write` zero-point values for each channel.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 *  - `Y`, `X`, `K`, and `BSO` must all point to word-aligned memory addresses.
 *  - `0 <= chans_to_write <= 16`  (though 0 is an expensive no-op)
 *  - `K_c` and `Y_c` must be a multiple of 4.

 * 
 * `window_hstride` is the number of _bytes_ by which the convolution window will be

 * @brief Compute a row of output pixels for a deep 2D convolution (Full @ttref{VPU_INT8_ACC_PERIOD} channels) 
 * 
 * A deep 2D convolution is one in which each output channel is a function of every input channel. This function
 * is intended to be invoked multiple times to do a full 2D convolution. Each invocation will compute 
 * @ttref{VPU_INT8_ACC_PERIOD} channels on each of `out_cols` pixels in a single row of @tensor{Y}.
 * 
 * `y` points to output tensor @tensor{Y} with shape @tensor_shape{Y_h, Y_w, Y_c}. @math{Y_w} must
 * be at least `out_cols`, and @math{Y_c} must be at least @ttref{VPU_INT8_ACC_PERIOD}. Rather than pointing
 * at the start of @tensor{Y}, the `y` passed to this function should point to the first channel to be output
 * of the first pixel to be output. The address to which `y` points will be the first memory written.
 * 
 * `x` points to the input tensor @tensor{X} with shape @tensor_shape{X_h, X_w, X_c}. Rather than pointing
 * at the start of @tensor{X}, the `x` passed to this function should point to the beginning of the first 
 * pixel of the convolution window. If the convolution window starts in padding, then this *may point
 * outside of @tensor{X}.
 * 
 * For example, the diagram below shows a `3x3` convolution being applied to a `4x4` image. The input image pixels
 * are marked with `X`'s, and the (implied) padding is marked with `P`'s. In this case, the convolution window 
 * starts in the padding at `(-1, -1, 0)` in @vector{X}'s coordinate space (i.e. @math{X[-1][-1]}) as is indicated 
 * by `P*` in the diagram. If `X_image` points to the start of the input image, then the argument `x` should 
 * be `(nn_image_t*) &X_image[-1][-1][0]`.

 * 
 * `k` points to the kernel tensor @tensor{K} with shape @tensor_shape{Y_c, K_h, K_w, X_c}. @math{Y_c} and 
 * @math{X_c} are the channel counts of the output and input images respectively. @math{K_h} and @math{K_w}
 * are the spatial height and width of the 2D convolution window respectively, expressed in pixels. Rather than
 * pointing at the start of @tensor{K}, the `k` passed to this function should point to the beginning of the
 * <b>final</b> channel of the output channel group being processed in the call.
 * 
 * For example, if @tensor{K} has shape @tensor_shape{48,5,5,32}, defined as `nn_tensor_t kernel[48][5][5][32]`,
 * then to process the output channel group (output channels `16` through `31`), then the address passed to this
 * call as `k` should be `&kernel[31][0][0][0]`. The `KERNEL_4D_COG_LAST_CHAN_START()` macro can be used to 
 * simplify this. The memory layout of @tensor{K} is the standard memory layout for 4D tensors (see 
 * @ref standard_layout).
 * 
 * `bso` points to the `nn_bso_block_t` describing the biases, shifts and scale for the current group of output 
 * channels. `bso` can be initialized with `nn_standard_BSO_layout()`. See @ref bso_layout for more information.
 * 
 * `K_height` and `K_width` are the height and width respectively of the 2D convolution window.
 * 
 * `K_hori_stride` is the horizontal stride (in pixels) taken by the 2D convolution window between between
 * output pixels.
 * 
 * `C_in` (or @math{X_c}) is the number of channels in the input image @tensor{X}.
 * 
 * `pad_t` and `pad_b` are the number of rows of padding at the top and bottom of the convolution window 
 * respectively. Because this function computes a horizontal strip of output pixels, the padding at the
 * top and bottom of the convolution window does not change during one invocation. These values are non-negative, 
 * and so 'negative' amounts of top or bottom padding should be conveyed as zeros. See example below.
 * 
 * `pad_l_initial` and `pad_r_initial` are the number of columns of padding at the left and right sides of the 
 * convolution window at the begining of the operation. Because this function computes a horizontal strip of output
 * pixels, the amount of left and right padding may change during an invocation. Unlike `pad_t` and `pad_b`, 
 * `pad_l_initial` and `pad_r_initial` indicate the *signed* padding, where gaps between the convolution window
 * and the edge of the input image may be negative, as in the following example.

 * 
 * The diagram above shows a `4x3` convolution window over a `5x5` image. In this case, `pad_t` is `1`, because the
 * top row of the convolution window is outside the input image. `pad_b` is `0`, because the bottom of the convolution
 * window is 2 pixels above the bottom of the image. `pad_l_initial` is `1`, because the left column of the 
 * convolution window is outside the input image. And `pad_r_initial` is `-3`, because if the convolution window
 * moves to the right 3 pixels, the edge of the convolution window will coincide with the edge of the input image.
 * Note also that `pad_r_initial` is *independent of* `K_hori_stride`; `pad_r_initial` is expressed as *input image*
 * pixels, not *output image* pixels.
 * 
 * `x_v_stride` is the memory stride required to move a pointer from (immediately after) the right edge of the 
 * convolution window to (immediately after) the left edge of the convolution window on the following row (note:

 * 
 * `k_cout_stride` is the memory stride required to move a pointer from the beginning of one output channel of
