 * 
 * NOTE: The fields in this struct are named with the assumption that typical behavior is desired.
 *       e.g. rectangular input window and rectangular output region.
 * 
 * NOTE: The model makes the mapping of inputs to outputs look complicated. However, under 
 *       normal circumstances, each of the following will be true:
 *          `window.outer_stride.vertical.cols == 0`
 *          `window.outer_stride.horizontal.rows == 0`
 *          `window.outer_stride.vertical.channels == 0`
 *          `window.outer_stride.horizontal.channels == 0`
 *          `window.inner_stride.vertical.cols == 0`
 *          `window.inner_stride.horizontal.rows == 0`
 *          `window.inner_stride.vertical.channels == 0`
 *          `window.inner_stride.horizontal.channels == 0`
 *          `output.stride.vertical.cols == 0`
 *          `output.stride.horizontal.rows == 0`
 *          `output.stride.vertical.channels == 0`
 *          `output.stride.horizontal.channels == 0`
 *       When each of those is true, the model greatly simplifies, such that vertical iterations
 *       only interact with rows, and horizontal iterations only interact with cols.
 * 
 *       Additionally, the following will also usually be true:
 *          `window.inner_stride.vertical.rows == 1`
 *          `window.inner_stride.horizontal.cols == 1`
 *          `output.stride.vertical.rows == 1`
 *          `output.stride.horizontal.rows == 1`
 *       When these are also true, the operator behaves in the usual way, where outputs form
 *       a rectangualr sub-tensor in the output image, and where each pixel is mapped from
 *       a rectangular sub-tensor in the input image.
 * 
 * NOTE: In the descriptions for fields, vectors are described as a 3-tuple `[r, c, ch]`, 
 * where 3 elements correspond to index changes in a 3-dimensional image tensor.
 *       `r` is a row delta, `c` is a column delta and `ch` is a channel delta.
