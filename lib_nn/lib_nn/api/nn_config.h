/**
 * @macro CONFIG_SYMMETRIC_SATURATION_GLOBAL
 * @brief Configure whether (supported) operators use `-127` or `-128` as the their lower saturation bound.
 * 
 * The output of 8-bit arithmetic on the XS3 VPU has natural symmetric saturation bounds of (`-127`, `127`). This may be
 * unacceptable, in which case (`-128`, `127`) can be used instead.
 * 
 * If `CONFIG_SYMMETRIC_SATURATION_GLOBAL` is defined, it is used as the value for each config macro 
 * `CONFIG_SYMMETRIC_SATURATION_*` (e.g. `CONFIG_SYMMETRIC_SATURATION_requantize_16_to_8`), unless 
 * that macro has been explicitly set.
 * 
 * Bypassing the symmetric saturation bound requires additional logic, and so will generally make the
 * operators slower, though this will be more or less significant, depending on the specific
 * operators.
