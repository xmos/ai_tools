/** 
 * @brief Initialize an instance of the @oper{conv2d_deep} operator.
 * 
 * See @oper_ref{conv2d_deep} for more details about the @oper{conv2d_deep} operator. To invoke a @oper{conv2d_deep} 
 * job, call conv2d_deep().
 * 
 * When conv2d_deep() is called, a plan (`nn_conv2d_deep_plan_t`) and a job (`nn_conv2d_deep_job_t`) must be supplied 
 * to tell it how to do its work. This function initializes that plan and one or more jobs to be supplied in subsequent 
 * calls to conv2d_deep().
 * 
 * A plan contains information shared by all jobs of an instance of @oper{conv2d_deep}. Each job computes a rectangular 
 * sub-tensor of the output image (possibly the entire image).
 * 
 * `plan` points to the plan to be initialized. It need only be initialized once for many calls to conv2d_deep().
 * 
 * `jobs` points to an array of `nn_conv2d_deep_job_t` to be initialized. Each element represents one job. There should 
 * be `job_count` elements in the array.
 * 
 * `x_params` points to the image parameters for the instance's input image @tensor{X}.
 * 
 * `y_params` points to the image parameters for the instance's output image @tensor{Y}.
 * 
 * `job_params` points to either an array of `nn_conv2d_job_params_t` structs or else is `NULL`. A `job_params` value of  
 * `NULL` indicates that there will only be a single job which computes the entire output image. If `job_params` is 
 * `NULL`, then `job_count` must be `1`. If `job_params` is not `NULL`, it must point to an array of `job_count` 
 * `nn_conv2d_job_params_t` elements.
 * 
 * In particular, job `k` will compute the output elements @math{Y[r,c,p]} for which:
 * @inlinecode
 *     job_params[k].start.rows <= r < job_params[k].start.rows + job_params[k].size.rows
 *     job_params[k].start.cols <= c < job_params[k].start.cols + job_params[k].size.cols
 *     job_params[k].start.channels <= p < job_params[k].start.channels + job_params[k].size.channels
 * @endinlinecode
 * 
 * If multiple jobs are specified, it is the user's responsibility to ensure that the supplied list of job params 
 * collectively computes the entire output image (no gaps) and does not compute any output values redundantly (no 
 * overlap).
 * 
 * `conv_window` points to a `nn_window_params_t` struct containing the instance's @math{K_h}, @math{K_w}, 
 * @math{W_{vert}), @math{W_{hori}), @math{W_{r0}) and @math{W_{c0}} hyperparameters (see @ref 
 * conv2d_deep_hyperparameters) which describe the relationship between the input image, the convolution window and the 
 * output image.
 * 
 * `conv_window->shape` specified @math{K_w} and @math{K_h}, the height and width of the convolution window. 
 * 
 * `conv_window->start` specifies @math{W_{r0}} and @math{W_{c0}}, the starting row and column of the convolution window 
 * in @tensor{X}'s coordinate space. For example, a `start` value of `(0,0)` indicates that the top-left pixel of the 
 * output image has the convolution window aligned with the top-left corner of the input image, with no implied padding 
 * at the top or left sides of the input image.
 * 
 * `conv_window->stride.horizontal` specifies @math{W_{vert}} and @math{W_{hori}}, the vertical and horizontal strides 
 * of the convolution window. The strides describe the number of pixels the convolution window moves (across the input 
 * image) with each pixel in the output image.
 * 
 * `zero_point` specifies @math{z_0}, the value associated with the (implied) padding space around the input image. For 
 * any output pixel whereupon the corresponding convolution window location in the input image extends beyond the bounds 
 * of the input image, those coefficients in the convolution window which are in the padding are multiplied by 
 * @math{z_0} rather than by values from the input image. All input channels currently share a common zero-point value.
 *
