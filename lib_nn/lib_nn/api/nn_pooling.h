/** 
 * @brief Invoke a @oper{avgpool2d_global} job.
 * 
 * The @oper{avgpool2d_global} operator computes a scaled and biased sum of pixel values for each channel of an input
 * image, producing an 8-bit vector of outputs.
 * 
 * See @oper_ref{avgpool2d_global} for more details about the @oper{avgpool2d_global} operator, including the 
 * mathematical details of the operation performed.
 * 
 * @par Operator Plans and Jobs
 * 
 * Invoking an instance of @oper{avgpool2d_global} requires a plan and a job. The plan and one or more jobs may be 
 * initialized with the avgpool2d_global_init() function. Each job computes a contiguous subset of the output elements.
 * 
 * @par Parameter Details
 * 
 * `Y` points to the 8-bit output vector @tensor{y} with length @tensor_shape{X_c}.
 * 
 * `X` points to the 8-bit input image @tensor{X} with shape @tensor_shape{X_h, X_w, X_c}. The memory layout of 
 * @tensor{X} is the standard memory layout for image tensors (see @ref standard_layout).
 * 
 * `bias` is the 32-bit bias @math{b} with which the accumulators are initialized for each output. Note that the 
 * right-shift by @math{r} bits is applied after all accumulation. To add an absolute offset of @math{b_0} to each
 * result, then the value used for @math{b} should be @math{b_0 \cdot 2^r}.
 * 
 * `scale` is the 8-bit coefficient @math{s}. All pixel values are multiplied by @math{s} and added to the 32-bit 
 * accumulator.
 * 
 * `shift` is the (rounding) right-shift @math{r} applied to each 32-bit accumulator to yield an 8-bit result. Note 
 * that this is a saturating right-shift which will saturate to 8-bit bounds (see additional remarks below).
 * 
 * `plan` points to the (initialized) plan associated with this instance of the @oper{avgpool2d_global} operator.
 * 
 * `job` points to the (initialized) job to be performed with this call.
 * 
 * @par Parameter Constraints
 * 
 * The arguments `Y` and `X` must each point to a word-aligned address.
 * 
 * Due to memory alignment requirements, @math{X_c} must be a multiple of @math{4}, which forces all pixels to begin at
 * a word-aligned address.
 * 
 * @par Splitting the Workload
 * 
 * Jobs are used to split the work done by an instance of @oper{avgpool2d_global}. Each job computes a (contiguous)
 * subset of the elements of @tensor{y}. The elements to be computed by a job are specified when the jobs are 
 * initialized by avgpool2d_global_init().
 * 
 * @par Additional Remarks
 * 
 * The arguments `Y` and `X` should both point at the beginning of their respective objects, even if the job being 
 * invoked does not start at the beginning of the output vector.
 * 
 * By default this operator uses the standard 8-bit limits @math([-128, 127]) when applying saturation logic. Instead,
 * it can be configured to use symmetric saturation bounds @math([-127, 127]) by defining 
 * `CONFIG_SYMMETRIC_SATURATION_avgpool2d_global` appropriately. See @ref nn_config.h for more details. Note that this
 * configures _all_ instances of the @oper{avgpool2d_global} operator.
 * 
 * If @math{X_c} is not a multiple of @math{16}, this operator may read up to 12 bytes following the end of @tensor{X}. 
 * This is not ordinarily a problem. However, if the object to which `X` points is located very near the end of a valid 
 * memory address range, it is possible memory access exceptions may occur when this operator is invoked.
 * 
 * If necessary, this can be avoided by manually forcing a buffer region (no more than @math{12} bytes are necessary) 
 * following @tensor{X}. There are various ways this can be accomplished, including embedding these objects in larger 
 * structures.
 * 
 * @param [out] Y       The output vector @tensor{y}
 * @param [in]  X       The input image @tensor{X}
 * @param [in]  bias    Initial 32-bit accumulator value @math{b}. Shared by all channels.
 * @param [in]  scale   The factor @math{s} by which input pixel values are scaled.
 * @param [in]  shift   The right-shift @math{r} applied to the 32-bit accumulators to yield an 8-bit result.
 * @param [in]  plan    The @oper{avgpool2d_global} plan to be processed
 * @param [in]  job     The @oper{avgpool2d_global} job to be processed
