 * if necessary by storing the data in the layout specified in the secion "Bias-Shifts-Scale 
 * Tensor Layout". To understand how these values are used, see the section "Notes on Output
 * Shifts and Scales".
 * 
 * `bias` is a pointer to a 1-D vector with length `C_out` of 32-bit biases. `shift1`, `scale` 
 * and `shift2` are each pointers to 1-D vectors with length `C_out` of 16-bit elements. In
 * each case, the `i`th element corresponds to output channel `i`.
 * 
 * If `bss_out` and `bias` do not point to the same memory location, it will be assumed that
 * the `bss_out` tensor does not overlap the memory of the `bias`, `shift` and `scale`
 * vectors. In this case, the `scratch` input will be ignored, and no memory will be allocated.
 * 
 * If the `bss_out` and `bias` pointers do point to the same memory location, a temporary scratch 
 * buffer is needed to perform the reformatting. In this case, if the `scratch` parameter is not
 * `NULL`, the memory to which it points will be used as the scratch buffer. If the `scratch` 
 * parameter is `NULL`, memory will be `malloc`ed for a scratch buffer. That memory will be `free`ed
 * before returning.
 * 
 * The `bss_out` tensor must be large enough to hold `(5 * ((C_out + 15)//16) * 16)` elements
 * of type `data16_t`. `((C_out + 15)//16)*16` is the number of output channels rounded up
 * to the nearest multiple of `16`.
 * 
 * If `scratch` is provided, it must be large enough to store all `C_out` elements of the
 * `bias`, `shift` and `scale` vectors.
 * 
 * \param bss_out   The output tensor to be written
 * \param bias      The bias vector
