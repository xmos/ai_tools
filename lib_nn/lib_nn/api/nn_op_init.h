/** 
 * @brief Prepare an execution plan for a 2D deep convolution.
 * 
 * When `conv2d_deep()` is called, a plan (`nn_conv2d_deep_plan_t`) and a
 * job (`nn_conv2d_deep_job_t`) must be supplied to tell it how to do its work. This 
 * function initializes that plan and one or more jobs to be supplied in subsequent calls
 * to `conv2d_deep()`.
 * 
 * A plan contains information shared by all jobs. A job, when provided to `conv2d_deep()`,
 * computes a rectangular sub-tensor of the output image (possibly the entire image).
 * 
 * `plan` is a pointer to the execution plan to be initialized. It need only be 
 * initialized once for many calls to `conv2d_deep()`.
 * 
 * `jobs` is a pointer, supplied by the caller to an array of `nn_conv2d_deep_job_t` 
 * structs which will be initialized by this function. `job_count` jobs will be 
 * initialized.
 * 
 * `x_params` is a pointer to image parameters for an input image @tensor{X} that will be
 * passed to `conv2d_deep()` in subsequent calls.
 * 
 * `y_params` is a pointer to image parameters for an output image @tensor{Y} that will be
 * computed by subsequent calls to `conv2d_deep()`.
 * 
 * `job_params` points to either an array of `nn_conv2d_job_params_t` structs or else
 * is `NULL`. A `job_params` value of  `NULL` indicates that there will only be a single
 * job which computes the entire output image. If `job_params` is `NULL`, then `job_count` 
 * must be `1`. If `job_params` is not `NULL`, it must point to an array containing 
 * `job_count` `nn_conv2d_job_params_t` elements.
 * 
 * It is the callers responsibility to ensure that the supplied list of job params
 * collectively computes the entire output image. It is also the caller's responsibility
 * to ensure that the supplied list of jobs does not include duplicate calculation of
 * outputs.
 * 
 * `conv_window` points to a `nn_conv2d_window_params_t` struct which describes the 
 * relationship between the input image, the convolution window and the output image.
 * `conv_window->shape` describes the height and width of the convolution window. 
 * 
 * `conv_window->start` specifies where the top-left cell of the convolution window is
 * placed, relative to the top-left pixel of the input image, for the top-left pixel of
 * the output image. For example, a `start` value of `(0,0)` indicates that the top-left 
 * pixel of the output image has the convolution window aligned with the top-left corner
 * of the input image, with no implied padding a the top or left side of the input image.
 * 
 * `conv_window->stride.horizontal` indicates how many pixels to the right the convolution
 * window moves (across the input image) for each pixel moved to the right in the output image. 
 * `conv_window->stride.vertical` indicates how many pixels downwards the convolution
 * window moves (across the input image) for each pixel moved downwards in the output image.
 * 
 * `zero_point` specifies the value associated with the (implied) padding space around the input
 * image. For any output pixel whereupon the corresponding convolution window location
 * in the input image extends beyond the bounds of the input image, those coefficients
 * in the convolution window which are in the padding are multiplied by `zero_point`
 * rather than by values from the input image. All input channels currently share a
 * common zero-point value.
 * 
 * `job_count` indicates the number of elements in the `jobs` array that is supplied 
 * by the user, as well the number of elements in the `job_params` array if it is not
 * `NULL`.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 *  - @math{X_c} (i.e. `x_params->channels`) and @math{Y_c} (i.e. `y_params->channels`) must 
 *    each be a multiple of `4`.
 * 
 * 
 * @param[out] plan         The plan to be initialized
 * @param[out] jobs         Array of jobs to be initialized (length: `job_count`)
 * @param[in]  x_params     Parameters describing the shape of each input image tensor @tensor{X}
 * @param[in]  y_params     Parameters describing the shape of each output image tensor @tensor{K}
 * @param[in]  job_params   Array with configuration parameters for each job, or `NULL`
 * @param[in]  conv_window  Parameters describing the relationship between the convolution window, the
 *                          input image and hte output image
 * @param[in]  zero_point   The value to be used (for all channels) for padding
 * @param[in]  job_count    The number of jobs to initialize
